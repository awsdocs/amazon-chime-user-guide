If you have the Amazon Chime client app installed on a mobile device, you can choose how you receive inbound meetings and calls on that device\. The following options are provided in the settings that control how you are notified for Amazon Chime meetings and calls:
+ **Call this device for scheduled meetings \(on by default\)** – Your device rings for both scheduled, occasional, and instant meetings\. Turn this setting off if you do not want this device to ring when a scheduled meeting begins\. However, the device still rings for occasional and instant meetings\.
+ **Play Amazon Chime ringtone \(on by default\)** – The Amazon Chime ringtone plays for calls and meetings\. Turn this setting off if you want to turn off the sound and just receive a notification when the call starts\.
