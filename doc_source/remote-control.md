# Requesting Desktop Control<a name="remote-control"></a>

If you want to take control of another attendee's desktop, you can do so as long as you are sharing your entire screen on the Windows or macOS desktop app\. This is especially useful for demonstration or troubleshooting purposes\. For more information about screen sharing, see [Sharing Your Screen](screen-share.md)\.

**To use request desktop control**

1. The other user shares their entire desktop instead of only a window\.

1. Choose **Share**, **Request Shared Control**\.

1. The other users choose **Allow** to allow shared control\. The gold band around the desktop turns red, and cursors of both users are labeled\. 

1. To end the shared session, either the viewer or the sharer chooses **End**\.

**Note**  
Desktop control can't be requested or accepted when screen sharing from the Amazon Chime web app\.
