# Joining an Amazon Chime meeting<a name="join-meetings"></a>

Amazon Chime provides several ways to join a meeting\. How you join depends on your environment and the features that you want to use\. To determine the best way to join, review these criteria to see which items apply to you\.

**Note**  
Meetings can sometimes open in a browser when you expect them to open in the desktop client\. That happens when you sign into the web app and you click a meeting link\. It also happens when you sign into Slack and you join an Amazon Chime meeting on the web\. In either case, you can sign out of the web app and launch the Amazon Chime client\.
+ Audio configurations
**Note**  
To avoid an echo, choose one audio source for each room\.
  + If you have audio delivered over voice over IP – or VoIP – you can use any of the Amazon Chime clients, mobile and desktop\. Make sure to connect your device to a stable network\.
  + To attend a meeting hosted in a large conference room that has built\-in microphones and speakers, or if you prefer to use a telephone, choose to dial in to your meeting\. Amazon Chime Pro includes international access numbers and toll\-free numbers\. To use them, in the Amazon Chime client, select **Meetings**, **Schedule a Meeting**\.
  + If you want to join a meeting hosted in a room with a built\-in video conference system, and that system is compatible with Amazon Chime, you can use the audio from that device\.
+ Screen share features
  + To share your screen with meeting attendees, you can use an Amazon Chime client that runs on a supported Windows or macOS device, or a supported in\-room video system\. Make sure that your device is connected to a stable network\.
  + To view someone’s screen share, you can use any of the mobile or desktop Amazon Chime clients, or the web client in a supported browser\. The web client is ideal for attendees who need to view a screen share but can't install add\-ins or other software on their devices\.
+ Video features
  + If you want to use the video features, you can use the Amazon Chime client running on a Windows, macOS, or iOS device, or via an in\-room video system\.
