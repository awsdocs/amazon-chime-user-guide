# Removing yourself from a recurring meeting<a name="remove-recurring"></a>

Most of the time, you can use your calendar application to remove yourself from a recurring meeting\. However, you may still receive auto calls from the meeting series, even if it doesn't appear on your calendar\. If that happens, use one of the Amazon Chime clients to remove yourself from recurring meetings\. Follow these steps\.

**Note**  
Don't follow these steps to remove yourself from a single meeting in a series\. Also, don't follow these steps if you organize or host a meeting\. Instead, see [ Canceling a recurring meeting](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chime/latest/ug/scheduling-meetings.html#cancel-recurring-meeting)\.

**To remove yourself from a recurring meeting**

1. In Amazon Chime, choose **Home**\.

1. A list of **In progress meetings** and **Upcoming meetings**—meetings starting in the next 30 minutes—appears\.

1. Select a meeting, and choose **Remove me from series**\.

1. When prompted, confirm the deletion\.

Amazon Chime stops auto\-calling you for the remaining meetings in the series, and your name stops appearing on the meeting roster\.

**Note**  
If you ask to be removed but you're still on the calendar invitation, you may receive auto calls if someone updates the event\. To ensure removal, contact the meeting organizer and ask to be removed from the meeting series\.
