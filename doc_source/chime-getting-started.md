# Getting started with Amazon Chime<a name="chime-getting-started"></a>

You use Amazon Chime to chat with others and participate in meetings\. To get started, [download the Amazon Chime desktop app](download.md) or use the Amazon Chime web app at [https://app\.chime\.aws](https://app.chime.aws), and then create an [Amazon Chime user account](create-account.md)\.

You don't need a user account if you only want to join meetings\. If you create an account, you can use the Amazon Chime Pro features for 30 days at no charge\.

**Note**  
If you accept an invitation from an Amazon Chime administrator, that administrator assigns you Pro or Basic permissions\.

When the 30\-day Pro trial ends, you can continue to use Amazon Chime with Basic permissions for free\. Users with Basic permissions cannot host meetings, but they can initiate one\-on\-one meetings, attend larger meetings, and use chat\. For more information about Pro and Basic features, see [Plans and pricing](http://aws.amazon.com/chime/pricing)\.

To continue using Amazon Chime with Pro permissions after the 30\-day free trial period ends, you or your administrator must create an AWS account, then an Amazon Chime administrator account, and add you to the administrator account as a user with Pro permissions\. For more information, see [Getting started](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chime/latest/ag/getting-started.html) in the *Amazon Chime Administrator Guide*\.
