# Using the meeting roster<a name="mobile-meeting-roster"></a>

By default, the meeting roster appears when you first join a meeting\. The roster displays tiles with the name and initials of each meeting attendee\. A colored border indicates the active speaker\.

A crown icon, ![\[Icon of a small crown.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/chime/latest/ug/images/crown-icon.png), represents the meeting organizer or host\. 

The microphone indicates whether an attendee is muted\. ![\[Image of a microphone with a diagonal slash over it.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/chime/latest/ug/images/mobile-mic-icon-muted.png)
