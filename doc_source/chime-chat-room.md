# Create a Chat Room<a name="chime-chat-room"></a>

To collaborate in a less direct way on projects, invite others during escalations, or discussions topics or teams on an ongoing basis, you can create a chat room\.

**To create a chat room**

1. Choose **Rooms**, **New Room**\.

1. Enter a name for the chat room and choose **Create**\.

1. Add members from your contact list\.

1. Invitees receive an Amazon Chime notification and the chat room automatically opens on their desktop app\. \(Mobile users receive push notifications\.\)

1. Members are listed on the right side of the chat room\.

1. To start an instant meeting, choose the phone receiver icon and choose a single member, multiple members, or the entire chat room\.

1. To close the chat room but remain a member, choose the red X next to the name of the chat room\.

1. To leave the chat room \(you must be re\-invited to return\), choose **Settings**, **Leave the chat room**\.

## Administer a Chat Room<a name="chat-admins"></a>

Chat room administrators have a crown icon next their names\. Administrators can add or edit members, edit the chat room name and invite policy, and delete the chat room and thread history under **Settings**\.

 Administrators can't leave the chat room if they are the only administrator\. They must promote another member to administrator before they leave\.

To make someone an administrator, choose **Settings**, **Edit Members**, select a member, and then choose **Make Administrator**\.

## Send Notifications<a name="at-mention"></a>

Because chat rooms are continuous conversations, you can send an audible notification \(a sound on your desktop or a push notification on your mobile device\) to call attention to new messages\.

Type @ or choose **At\-mention** and select a member’s name, the entire chat room, or present members\. Chosen members see new messages in bold with their name highlighted\. If they’re online but the chat room is closed, the chat room pops open automatically on their screens\.

## Join a Chat Room<a name="join-chat"></a>

 To join a chat room, accept the invite from the chat room administrator\. Only administrators can send chat room invites\.
