# Unblocking meeting audio and video in a browser<a name="unblock-audio-video"></a>

When you open an Amazon Chime meeting in a browser for the first time, a dialog box appears and asks if you want to block or allow audio and video\. If you accidentally choose to block audio or video, you can undo that choice\.

**To unblock audio and video**

1. On the left side of your browser's address bar, choose the icon next to **https://apps\.chime\.aws**\. Depending on your browser, the icon may be a lock, a camera, or a microphone\.

   A menu appears\. The menu varies, depending on your browser\.

1. As desired, enable audio and video\. You may need to open drop\-down lists or move sliders to do this\.

1. When finished, select an area outside the menu to close it\.
