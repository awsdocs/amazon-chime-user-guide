# Collaborating using Amazon Chime chat<a name="chime-using-chat"></a>

Amazon Chime gives you two ways to chat—Amazon Chime chat and in\-meeting chat\. The topics in this section explain how to use Amazon Chime chat, the screens that you use when you aren't in a meeting\. For information about using chat in meetings, see [Using in\-meeting chat](chime-chat.md)\.

In Amazon Chime chat, you can chat with colleagues directly, in a group, or in a chat room\. You can share attachments of up to 50 megabytes, search contacts, conversations, and chat rooms, and read conversations across all devices\.

You can also go to **Recent Messages** to see the latest one\-on\-one and group messages from the past 7 days, or choose **All messages** to browse through all of your chat conversation history\. Use **Favorites** to organize important threads\.

In the chat window, the following statuses indicate whether a user is available to chat\.
+ Green checkmark – The user is available\.
+ Red – The user is busy\.
+ Blue clock icon – The user is idle\.
+ Gray forward slash – The user is offline\.
+ Green mobile icon – The user is available on mobile\.
