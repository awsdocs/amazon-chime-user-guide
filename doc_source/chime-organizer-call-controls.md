# Hosting meetings<a name="chime-organizer-call-controls"></a>

You can schedule meetings if you have an Amazon Chime Pro account\. When you schedule a meeting, you automatically become the *host*\. As part of scheduling a meeting, you can choose to make it a moderated meeting and set a passcode that the system associates with the meeting ID\. In addition, you can create *delegates*, other Amazon Chime users who can schedule meetings on your behalf\.

Moderated meetings don't start until you, another moderator, or a delegate join the meeting, and users can't communicate until then\. For example, they can't use meeting chat\. When you or your delegates join a moderated meeting, the system recognizes you as a moderator and your meeting starts\. What's more, you can give your moderator passcode to other meeting attendees, and they can enter it to start the meeting\.

Once the meeting starts, moderators have a set of host controls that help manage the meeting\. The controls vary, depending on whether or not you join from a signed\-in Amazon Chime account\. 

Athenticated hosts, moderators, and delegates can take the following actions:
+ Mute all attendees
+ Start and stop recording
+ End the meeting for all attendees
+ Enable and disable Event Mode
+ Remove attendees except the host, moderators, and delegates
+ Lock and unlock the meeting

Unauthenticated hosts, moderators, and delegates can take the following actions:
+ Mute all attendees
+ Start and stop recording
+ End the meeting for all attendees
+ Lock and unlock the meeting

For more information about moderated meetings, see [Scheduling a moderated meeting](moderate-meeting.md)\. For more information about creating delegates, see [Assigning delegates](delegates.md)\.
