# Recording meetings<a name="record-meetings"></a>

If you are a meeting organizer, delegate, or moderator, you can record meetings\. Here's what you need to know:
+ You can record audio and screen sharing for up to 12 hours\.
+ By default, Amazon Chime only records video when someone shares their screen during the meeting\. Any parts of a meeting without a screen share appear as blank during playback\.
+ You can't record attendee video tiles, and attendees can't record meetings\.
+ You start recording after the meeting begins\.

**To record a meeting**

1. To start recording, choose **More**, then **Record meeting**\.

1. To stop recording, choose **More**, then **Stop recording**\.

Once you stop recording, Amazon Chime processes the recording\. By default, it creates MP4 files for meetings with screen sharing, and MP4a files for meetings without screen sharing\. The processing time varies, depending on meeting length\. Once processing ends, Chime sends you a message in regular Amazon Chime chat with a link to the file\. For security reasons, Amazon Chime packages the file as a download and places it in your downloads folder\. This is true for Windows and macOS computers\.
