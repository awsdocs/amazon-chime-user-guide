# Sharing your screen<a name="screen-share"></a>

Anyone joining a meeting with a supported Amazon Chime app can share their screen or request access control\.

To share your screen, choose **Screen**, and then choose **Share Screen** to share your whole screen, or **Share Window** to share a specific window\. Desktop users see a **Shared screen** pop\-up, and mobile users see an alert to ignore or view the shared screen\.

To stop notifications from appearing while you share your screen, update your Amazon Chime settings\. Choose **File**, **Settings**, **Notifications** in the Windows client, or **Amazon Chime**, **Preferences**, **Notifications** in the macOS client\. For **Meetings**, select **Suppress all notifications while screen sharing**, then choose **Done**\.

If you're sharing your entire screen on your Windows or macOS desktop app, one or multiple attendees can request keyboard and pointer control of your desktop by choosing **Share**, **Request Shared Control**\. For more information, see [Requesting desktop control](remote-control.md)\.

**Note**  
The Amazon Chime web application supports screen sharing on Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox browsers for Windows, macOS, and Linux desktops without requiring a plugin or extension\. If you installed the Amazon Chime screen share extension for Google Chrome \(used to provide screen sharing for Google Chrome versions 34 â€“ 71\), and you're running a more recent version of Google Chrome, Amazon Chime will bypass the extension and use the native Web API provided in the browser\.
