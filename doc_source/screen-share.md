# Share Your Screen<a name="screen-share"></a>

Anyone joining a meeting with a supported Amazon Chime app can share their screen or get remote access, not only the meeting organizer\.

To share your screen, choose **Screen**, and then choose **Share Screen** to share your whole screen, or **Share Window** to share a specific window\. Desktop users see a **Shared screen** pop\-up, and mobile users see an alert to ignore or view the shared screen\.

If you're sharing your entire screen on your Windows or macOS desktop app, one or multiple attendees can request keyboard and mouse control of your desktop by choosing **Share**, **Request Shared Control**\.

**Note**  
The Amazon Chime web app supports screen sharing on Chrome browsers for Windows, macOS, and Linux desktops with the installation of an extension\.
