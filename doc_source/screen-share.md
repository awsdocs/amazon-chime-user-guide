# Sharing your screen during an Amazon Chime meeting<a name="screen-share"></a>

Anyone joining a meeting from an Amazon Chime Windows or macOS client or a supported in\-room video system can share their screen\. You can also stop notifications from appearing while you're sharing your screen\.

**To share your screen during a meeting**

1. Choose **Screen**\.

1. Do one of the following:
   + Choose **Share Screen** to share your whole screen\.
   + Choose **Share Window** to share a specific window\.

Desktop users in the meeting see a **Shared screen** pop\-up, and mobile users see an alert to either view or ignore the shared screen\. Meeting attendees who view your shared screen can zoom in on it by using their pointer\.

If you're sharing your entire screen with the Amazon Chime client for Windows or macOS, one or multiple attendees can request keyboard and pointer control of your desktop by choosing **Share**, **Request Shared Control**\. For more information, see [Requesting desktop control](remote-control.md)\.

To stop notifications from appearing while you share your screen, update your Amazon Chime settings\.

**To suppress notifications while screen sharing**

1. Do one of the following:
   + **From the Windows client** – Choose **File**, **Settings**, **Notifications**\.
   + **From the macOS client** – Choose **Amazon Chime**, **Preferences**, **Notifications**\.

1. Select **Suppress all notifications while screen sharing**\.

1. Choose **Done**\.

**Note**  
The Amazon Chime web application supports screen sharing on Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox for Windows, macOS, and Linux desktops\. You don't need a plugin or extension\. If you installed the Amazon Chime screen share extension for Google Chrome versions 34 \-71, and you now run a more recent version of Google Chrome, Amazon Chime bypasses the extension and uses the browser's native capabilities\.
