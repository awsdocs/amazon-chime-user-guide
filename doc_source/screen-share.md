# Share Your Screen<a name="screen-share"></a>

Anyone who has the Amazon Chime desktop app installed can share their screen or get remote access, not only the meeting organizer\.

To share your screen, choose **Screen**, and then choose **Share Screen** to share your whole screen, or **Share Window** to share a specific window\. Desktop users see a **Shared screen** pop\-up, and mobile users see an alert to ignore or view the shared screen\.

If you're sharing your entire screen on your Windows or macOS desktop app, one or multiple attendees can request keyboard and mouse control of your desktop by choosing **Share**, **Request Shared Control**\.

**Note**  
You can't share your screen when using the Amazon Chime web app, but you can still view screens shared with you\.
