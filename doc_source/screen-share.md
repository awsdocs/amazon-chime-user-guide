# Sharing Your Screen<a name="screen-share"></a>

Anyone joining a meeting with a supported Amazon Chime app can share their screen or get remote access, not only the meeting organizer\.

To share your screen, choose **Screen**, and then choose **Share Screen** to share your whole screen, or **Share Window** to share a specific window\. Desktop users see a **Shared screen** pop\-up, and mobile users see an alert to ignore or view the shared screen\.

If you're sharing your entire screen on your Windows or macOS desktop app, one or multiple attendees can request keyboard and mouse control of your desktop by choosing **Share**, **Request Shared Control**\. For more information, see [Requesting Desktop Control](remote-control.md)\.

**Note**  
The Amazon Chime web application supports screen sharing on Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox browsers for Windows, macOS, and Linux desktops without requiring a plugin or extension\. If you installed the Amazon Chime screen share extension for Google Chrome \(used to provide screen sharing for Google Chrome versions 34 â€“ 71\), and you're running a more recent version of Google Chrome, Amazon Chime will bypass the extension and use the native Web API provided in the browser\.
