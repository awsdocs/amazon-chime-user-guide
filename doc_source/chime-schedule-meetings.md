Amazon Chime Pro users can choose whether to allow external attendees to join their meetings\. They can also assign other Amazon Chime Pro users to schedule meetings on their behalf as delegates\. Delegates can attend meetings and access the same meeting actions that a meeting host can\. For more information about the meeting actions available to a delegate, see [Hosting a meeting](chime-organizer-call-controls.md)\.

Meeting hosts and delegates with Pro permissions can schedule moderated meetings, which only start when a moderator joins\. Meeting attendees who enter the moderator passcode can access additional meeting actions, such as locking, recording, and ending meetings, and muting all other attendees\. For more information, see [Moderator actions using the Amazon Chime app](moderate-meeting.md#actions-app)\.
