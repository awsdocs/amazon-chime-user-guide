# Scheduling meetings using Amazon Chime<a name="chime-schedule-meetings"></a>

Amazon Chime Pro users can schedule Amazon Chime meetings from their calendar app, including apps such as Outlook and Google Calendar\. They can also use auto\-call to automatically call their meeting attendees\.

**Note**  
When Amazon Chime Pro users schedule a meeting, or someone schedules a meeting on their behalf, they become meeting *hosts*\. Hosting allows you to take several actions, such as enabling event mode\. For more information about the actions that hosts can take, see [Hosting meetings](chime-organizer-call-controls.md), and the [ Who is the host of a meeting and what can they do? ](http://aws.amazon.com/blogs/https://answers.chime.aws/questions/1374/who-is-the-host-of-a-meeting-and-what-can-they-do.html?childToView=1375#answer-1375) blog post\.

Amazon Chime Pro users can allow external attendees to join their meetings\. They can also create *delegates*, other Amazon Chime Pro users who can schedule meetings on their behalf\. Delegates can attend meetings and access the same meeting actions as the meeting host\. For more information about the meeting actions available to a delegate, see [Hosting meetings](chime-organizer-call-controls.md)\.

Meeting hosts and delegates with Pro permissions can also schedule moderated meetings, which only start when a moderator joins\. Meeting attendees who enter the moderator passcode can access additional meeting actions, such as locking, recording, and ending meetings, and muting all other attendees\. For more information about moderated meetings, see [Moderator actions using the Amazon Chime app](moderate-meeting.md#actions-app)\.
