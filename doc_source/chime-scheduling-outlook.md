You can schedule Amazon Chime meetings one of two ways using the Outlook for Windows Add\-in: either from the Amazon Chime app, or from Outlook itself\. You can also add Amazon Chime to an existing meeting on your Outlook calendar\.

**To schedule a meeting using Outlook from the Amazon Chime app**

1. For **Schedule Meeting**, choose **Outlook Calendar**\.

1. For **Meeting Settings**, enter your information, including dial\-in numbers, which will be added to the meeting instructions\.

1. Choose one of the following options:

   + **Personal Meeting ID**—This is a personal meeting ID that is assigned to you\. It's a convenient way to schedule meetings, because you don't have to remember new meeting details for each new meeting\.

   + **One\-Time Meeting ID**—This is a 10\-digit pin that Amazon Chime generates that you can use for single or recurring meetings\. This is ideal for back\-to\-back, overlapping, or confidential meetings\.

1. Review the **Schedule Meetings Instructions** field, which is automatically populated\.

1. Choose **Schedule with Outlook**\.
**Note**  
If you haven't installed the Outlook add\-in, you receive a prompt to install it\. Follow the instructions in the prompt\. When asked to sign in to Amazon Chime, use the same credentials that you used to sign in to your other Amazon Chime clients\. Confirm that the add\-in was installed by seeing the Amazon Chime Outlook Add\-In at the top of Outlook\.

1. An Outlook invite appears, which includes meeting instructions\.

   **meet@chime\.aws** is included, which enables Auto\-call and automatically starts the meeting for registered attendees at the scheduled start time\.

1. Enter the date, time, additional attendees, and recurrence \(if any\)\.

1. Send the invite\.

**To schedule a meeting from Outlook**
