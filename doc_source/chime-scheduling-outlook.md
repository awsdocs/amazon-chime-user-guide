# Scheduling Meetings with the Add\-In for Outlook<a name="chime-scheduling-outlook"></a>

Amazon Chime provides two add\-ins for Outlook: the Amazon Chime Add\-In for Outlook on Windows and the Amazon Chime Add\-In for Outlook\. These add\-ins offer the same scheduling features, but support different types of users\. Microsoft Office 365 subscribers and organizations using on\-premises Microsoft Exchange 2013 or later can use the Amazon Chime Add\-In for Outlook\. Windows users with an on\-premises Exchange server running Exchange Server 2010 or earlier and Outlook 2010 users must use the Amazon Chime Add\-in for Outlook on Windows\.

Windows users who do not have permissions to install the Amazon Chime Add\-in for Outlook should opt for the Amazon Chime Add\-in for Outlook on Windows\. For information about which add\-in is right for you and your organization, see [Choosing the Right Outlook Add\-In](https://answers.chime.aws/articles/663/choosing-the-right-outlook-add-in.html)\. 

No matter which add\-in you use, the steps to schedule your meeting from Outlook are similar, with the following differences:
+ **Amazon Chime Add\-In for Outlook on Windows** – Opens a new window and prompts you to choose your meeting ID type before populating your event\.
+ **Amazon Chime Add\-In for Outlook** – Opens in a side panel within Outlook and prompts you to select your options within a form\.
