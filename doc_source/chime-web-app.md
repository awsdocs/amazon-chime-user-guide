# Using the Amazon Chime Web App<a name="chime-web-app"></a>

The Amazon Chime web app brings Amazon Chime meetings and chat to your browser\. The web app makes it easy for clients, vendors, and other third parties to join your meetings, even if they're new to Amazon Chime\. There's no need to create an account and no downloads are required to participate in meetings\. With the web app, the full Amazon Chime experience is available in the browser for users that choose to create an account\.
