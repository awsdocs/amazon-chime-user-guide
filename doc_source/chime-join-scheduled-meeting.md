# Joining scheduled meetings<a name="chime-join-scheduled-meeting"></a>

In Amazon Chime, a *scheduled meeting* is one where someone invites at least one attendee and puts the meeting on a calendar\. If your administrator enables auto\-calling for meetings, the meeting will call you when it starts\.

To join a scheduled meeting in the Amazon Chime mobile app, you first need to install the app from Google Play or the App Store\. Once you sign in to the app, Amazon Chime notifies you when a meeting starts, even if you don't have the app open\. You can join meetings while connected to a network, or by dialing in from your phone\.

As a best practice, install your calendar app on your phone\. That allows you to look up meeting invitations and schedule meetings\. For more information about scheduling meetings, see [Scheduling meetings](mobile-scheduling.md)\.

**Note**  
If you're a host or delegate for a moderated meeting, the meeting only starts when you join\. For more information, see [Scheduling a moderated meeting](moderate-meeting.md)\.
