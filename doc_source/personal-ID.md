# Choose a Meeting ID<a name="personal-ID"></a>

There are two types of meeting IDs: Personal Meeting IDs and One\-time Meeting IDs\.

Using a **Personal Meeting ID** is similar to using a traditional meeting bridge\. It's a convenient way to schedule meetings, because you don't have to remember meeting details for each new meeting that you schedule\. To set them up, add meet@chime\.aws as a meeting attendee in your meeting invite\. This type of meeting is more open, and should not be used for confidential or back\-to\-back meetings\.

A **One\-time Meeting ID** is a unique ID used for individual meetings or a meeting series\. This ensures that meeting attendees have dial\-in information specific to the meeting or meeting series, preventing back\-to\-back meetings from merging\. These are ideal for confidential, overlapping, and back\-to\-back meetings\.
