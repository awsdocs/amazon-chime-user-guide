# Choosing a Meeting Type<a name="personal-ID"></a>

The following meeting types are available when scheduling an Amazon Chime meeting:
+ **My personal meeting ID** – This option generates meeting instructions using the personal meeting ID assigned to you when you registered for Amazon Chime\. It is recommended for internal meetings and can be used for individual or recurring meetings\. If you have set up a personalized meeting link, it is included in the meeting instructions sent to your meeting attendees\. For more information, see [Setting a Personalized Link](chime-create-account.md#set-link)\. This type of meeting starts as soon as anyone joins\. Because this meeting type is more open, it should not be used for confidential or back\-to\-back meetings\.
+ **Generate a new ID** – This option generates a new, unique meeting ID that can be used for individual or recurring meetings that you host\. There is no limit to the number of unique IDs that can be associated with your Amazon Chime account\. Using a unique meeting ID provides meeting attendees with instructions that are specific to joining the meeting or meeting series\. This helps prevent back\-to\-back meetings from merging if one runs overtime\. This type of meeting is ideal for external, confidential, overlapping, and back\-to\-back meetings\.
+ **Generate a new ID and require moderator to start** – This option generates a new, unique meeting ID for a moderated meeting, and prompts you to assign a 4\-8 digit moderator passcode to the meeting ID\. Moderated meetings start only when a moderator joins by entering the moderator passcode\. Moderators are also granted host controls\. Meeting hosts and delegates who are signed in to their Amazon Chime client when they join the meeting are recognized as meeting moderators by default\. When joining over the phone or an in\-room video system, hosts and delegates can join as moderators by entering their their 13\-digit meeting ID\.
