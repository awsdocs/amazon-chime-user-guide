If you received an Amazon Chime invitation and want to join the meeting quickly, you can do so with your internet browser\. For more information, see [Join a Meeting without the Amazon Chime App](chime-join-meeting.md)\.

If you have some time before the meeting starts, you can install the Amazon Chime client and join the meeting anonymously\. For more information, see [Join a Meeting Anonymously](join-anonymous.md)\.

If you will use Amazon Chime regularly, it's a good idea to create an Amazon Chime account and download the app on all your devices\. For more information, see [Create an Amazon Chime Account](chime-create-account.md)\.
