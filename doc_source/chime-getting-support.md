# Getting support from an Amazon Chime administrator<a name="chime-getting-support"></a>

If an Amazon Chime administrator invited you to join Amazon Chime, and you later have trouble with Amazon Chime, contact that administrator for support\. In turn, the administrator submits a support request on your behalf\.

**Note**  
You must belong to a Team or Enterprise account to work with an administrator\.  
If you're an administrator and you need help filing a support request, see [Getting administrator support](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chime/latest/ag/chime-getting-admin-support.html) in the *Amazon Chime Administrator Guide*\.

If you can, provide your administrator with the following information:
+  A detailed description of your issue\.
+ The time the issue occurred, including your time zone\.
+ Your Amazon Chime version\. To find your version number:
  + In Windows, choose **Help**, **About Amazon Chime**\.
  + In OS X, choose **Amazon Chime**, **About Amazon Chime**\.
  + In iOS and Android, choose **Settings**, **About**\.
  + In the web application, next to your name, choose **Amazon Chime menu**, **About Amazon Chime**\.
+ The Log Reference ID\. To find this ID:
  + In Windows and OS X, choose **Help**, **Send Diagnostic Logs**\.
  + In iOS and Android, choose **Settings**, **Send Diagnostic Logs**\. 
  + In the web application, next to your name, choose **Amazon Chime menu**, **Settings**, **Send Diagnostic Logs**\.
+ If your issue is related to a meeting, the Meeting ID\.

**Note**  
If you created your Amazon Chime account as an individual user or as part of a group with no administrators, you can use the Amazon Chime Assistant to get attachments or delete your account\.
