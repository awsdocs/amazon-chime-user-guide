If you joined Amazon Chime after receiving an invitation from a Amazon Chime administrator to join their Team or Enterprise account, contact your administrator for support\. They can submit a ticket to request support on your behalf\. For more information, see [Getting administrator support](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chime/latest/ag/chime-getting-admin-support.html) in the *Amazon Chime Administrator Guide*\.

It's helpful to provide your administrator with the following information to include in the ticket:
+  A detailed description of your issue\.
+ The time the issue occured, including your time zone\.
+ Your Amazon Chime version\. To find your version number:
  + In Windows, choose **Help**, **About Amazon Chime**\.
  + In OS X, choose **Amazon Chime**, **About Amazon Chime**\.
  + In iOS and Android, choose **Settings**, **About**\.
  + In the web application, next to your name, choose **Amazon Chime menu**, **About Amazon Chime**\.
+ The Log Reference ID\. To find this ID:
  + In Windows and OS X, choose **Help**, **Send Diagnostic Logs**\.
  + In iOS and Android, choose **Settings**, **Send Diagnostic Logs**\. 
  + In the web application, next to your name, choose **Amazon Chime menu**, **Settings**, **Send Diagnostic Logs**\.
+ If your issue is related to a meeting, the Meeting ID\.
