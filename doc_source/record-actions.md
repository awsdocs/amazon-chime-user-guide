# Recording meetings<a name="record-actions"></a>

Hosts, their delegates, and moderators can record meetings\. Amazon Chime captures audio and screen sharing, but not attendee video, until recording stops\. If nobody shares a screen, the system generates an M4A audio file\. If any part of the meeting includes a screen share, the system delivers an MP4 file\. If portions of the meeting don't include screen sharing, those sections are blank\.

**Note**  
Recorded meeting files tend to be large\. To share them with attendees, upload them to a file\-sharing service, such as Amazon WorkDocs, or Amazon S3 and share the file link\.

**To record a meeting**
+ Open the **More** menu and choose **Start Recording** or **Stop Recording**\. 

  If you sign in from a phone or in\-room video system as a moderator—you enter the passcode—press **\*2**\.

Amazon Chime notifies attendees about the recording when they join\. Attendees who dial in to a meeting receive an audible notification\. Attendees who sign in to the desktop or web client see the Recording icon\. When recording stops, attendees receive another update\. Recording stops when the meeting ends, or when the host or moderator chooses **Stop Recording**\.

Remember the following about recording files:
+ The meeting host, delegate, or moderator who starts the recording receives the M4A or MP4 file in an Amazon Chime chat message\.
+ If you stop and restart recording during a meeting, you receive a file for each recorded segment\.
+ If a moderator starts recording from a phone or in\-room video system, or joins the meeting without signing into the Amazon Chime app, the meeting host receives the recording\.
