# Muting and unmuting<a name="chime-mute"></a>

You can mute and unmute your audio during an Amazon Chime meeting\. Remember the following about muting and unmuting\.
+ You can always mute and unmute yourself\.
+ If you sign in to a meeting, you can mute and unmute other attendees\.
+ If you sign in to a meeting, you can mute and unmute attendees who join via phone or an in\-room conference system\. But, you can't unmute attendees who join using their computer audio\.

Depending on how you connect to a meeting, the muting process varies slightly\. These steps explain each process\.

**To mute or unmute audio in the desktop client or a browser**
+ Do one of the following:
  + Choose **Mute** at the top of the meeting window\.
  + Choose the microphone icon at the top of the **Chat** window\.
  + For Windows, choose **Ctrl\+Y**\.
  + For macOS, choose **Cmd\+Y**\.

**To mute or unmute in the phone app**
+ Choose the microphone icon\.
**Note**  
The background color behind the icon changes to a darker green when you mute audio, but the line through the microphone remains visible\. The darker background always indicates a muted microphone\. Also, the microphone icon next to the attendee's name does change to indicate muted audio\.

**To mute or unmute other attendees**
+ On the meeting roster, do one of the following:
  + Choose the audio icon next to the attendee's name\.
  + Choose or right\-click the attendee's name, and choose **Mute** or **Unmute**\.

Attendees who join the meeting from a phone or in\-room video system can use their local devices to override the Amazon Chime mute controls\. For example, the mute button on their local device can override any unmute requests from Amazon Chime\. They can also press \*7 to mute and unmute themselves\. 

Finally, meeting hosts, delegates, and moderators who sign in to the Amazon Chime app can choose **Disable Attendee Unmute** to keep others from unmuting attendees\.
