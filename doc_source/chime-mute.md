# Mute and Unmute Others<a name="chime-mute"></a>

Mute and unmute audio, either by choosing **Mute** at the top of the meeting window, or by choosing the microphone icon at the top of the **Chat** window\. You can also use the keyboard shortcut **Ctrl\+Y**\.

To mute yourself or other callers individually, on the meeting roster, select the microphone icon next to the caller to mute\. When a caller is on mute, only they can unmute themselves\.
