# Raising your hand<a name="raise-hand"></a>

Meeting attendees can raise their hand during an Amazon Chime meeting to get the attention of the meeting presenter\. Meeting attendees can also see a queue of all the raised hands in the meeting, clear the queue, or lower their own hand if they no longer have a question\. Performing one of these actions results in a response message appearing in the meeting chat\.

Meeting attendees can raise their hand by choosing the **Raise my hand** icon in the meeting chat pane\. To lower their hand, they can choose **Lower my hand**\.

To view the queue of raised hands during a meeting, choose the **Show queue** icon in the meeting chat pane\. To clear the queue, choose **Clear queue**\.
