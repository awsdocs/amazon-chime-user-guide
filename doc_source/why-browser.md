# Why meetings sometimes open in your browser<a name="why-browser"></a>

When you choose an Amazon Chime meeting link in a calendar invitation, the meeting may open in a browser instead of the desktop client\. That happens when:
+ You choose the meeting link while using the Amazon Chime web application in your default browser\.
+ You choose the meeting link while using the Amazon Chime Meetings App for Slack\.

To launch the Amazon Chime desktop client instead of the web application, do one of the following:
+ In your browser, open the **More** menu and choose **Switch to native app**\.
+ In your browser, navigate to [https://app\.chime\.aws](https://app.chime.aws) and sign out\. Amazon Chime then prompts you to open the calendar invitation and choose the meeting link, which starts the meeting in the desktop client\.
