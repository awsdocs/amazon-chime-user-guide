# Supported commands<a name="assistant-commands"></a>

The Amazon Chime Assistant supports the following commands: 
+ **Get my attachments** allows you to access attachments that you uploaded to 1:1 chats, group chats, and chat rooms that you created\.

  After you send this command as a chat message to the Assistant, you receive instructions similar to the following\.

  **To confirm your attachment request, copy and paste this exact command:**

  ```
  Get my attachments ktsben
  ```

  You can submit this command one time per 7\-day period\.

  After you provide the requested confirmation, a link to a file appears in the chat thread\. The file takes about 24 hours to appear, and it contains a list of digitally signed links to your attachments\. If no attachments meet the criteria, the file is empty\. The chat message included with the file includes the date and time when the links expire, about 6 days after delivery\.

  Anyone who obtains the file can download the attachments, so keep the file safe\.
+ **Delete me** allows you to delete your profile and data from the Amazon Chime system\.

  After sending the command as a chat message to the Assistant, you receive instructions similar to the following\.

  **To confirm your account deletion request, copy and paste this exact command:**

  ```
  Delete me aofrkq
  ```

  You receive a confirmation message\. The confirmation is valid for 10 minutes\. If you don't confirm within 10 minutes, or you don't enter the command correctly, the Assistant provides a new confirmation code, and you can retry the request\.

  After you provide the requested confirmation, the system signs you out of Amazon Chime on all your devices\. You no longer have access to your chat, chat rooms, contacts, or scheduled meetings\.
**Note**  
The **Delete me** command removes the link between your Amazon Chime profile and your amazon\.com account, which you use to sign into Amazon Chime\. Your amazon\.com account is provided by amazon\.com\. To delete your associated amazon\.com account, go to http://amazon\.com\.
+ **Help** provides a description of, and instructions for, using the commands described here\.
