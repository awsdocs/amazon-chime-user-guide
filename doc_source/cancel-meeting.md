# Cancel a Meeting<a name="cancel-meeting"></a>

Meeting organizers can cancel a meeting from the original calendar application in which the meeting was created\.

If prompted, send the cancellation to all attendees\. Because **meet@chime\.aws** is included in the invitation, Amazon Chime is notified of the cancellation and won't start the meeting\.
