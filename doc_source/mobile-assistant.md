# Getting additional support<a name="mobile-assistant"></a>

If an administrator or administrative group invited you to use Amazon Chime, contact that person or group for assistance if you need technical support with the Amazon Chime mobile app\.

If you created your Amazon Chime account as an individual user, or as part of a group with no administrators, you can use the Amazon Chime Assistant to get attachments or delete your account\. For more information, see [Using the Amazon Chime Assistant](chime-using-assistant.md)\. 

You can also use the online forum at [https://answers\.chime\.aws/](https://answers.chime.aws/)\.
