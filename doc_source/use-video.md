# Enable Video<a name="use-video"></a>

Amazon Chime provides an HD video experience that makes meetings more productive and engaging\.

To enable your webcam and open the video bar, choose **Video**\. Up to 16 attendees video tiles are displayed in the video bar, on a first\-come, first\-served basis\. A camera icon is displayed next to the name of anyone sharing their video\.

You can also watch videos without enabling your own\. To disable video, either hover over your tile and choose the camera icon, or choose **Video**\. If you don’t want to see the video of yourself, choose **Settings**, **Show Preview for my Own Video**\.

To pause or play an attendee's video, choose the video tile\. Attendees don’t know when they’ve been paused\.

To move the video bar, choose **Pop\-out** or **Pop\-in**, or choose **Exit** to remove it completely\.
