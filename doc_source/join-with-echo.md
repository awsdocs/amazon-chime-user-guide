# Using Echo devices to join Amazon Chime meetings<a name="join-with-echo"></a>

Amazon Chime users in the U\.S\. can now use Echo devices to join meetings\. You can use an Echo Show 8 to join meetings with video, and all other Echo devices join meetings with audio\.

**Note**  
To join meetings, you must meet the system requirements listed here\. To schedule meetings, you must use one of the Amazon Chime clients\. For more information, see [Scheduling meetings using Amazon Chime](chime-schedule-meetings.md)\.

**System requirements for joining meetings with video**  
To join Amazon Chime meetings with video, you must have the following:
+ An Amazon Echo Show 8\.
+ An Alexa account in the U\.S\. marketplace\. Account names must end with amazon\.com\.
+ The language for your Echo device set to **US English**\.
+ Alexa communication enabled on your device\. For information about doing that, see [ Set Up Calling and Messaging ](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GHS4XD76UNEWHUEB) on the *Help & Customer Service* site\.
+ Meeting organizers must select the **Anyone with the meeting ID** check box\.
+ Optionally, you can use the Alexa app to link Alexa to an online calendar\. If you do, Alexa joins you to meetings automatically\. If you don't, at the time of the meeting you'll need to say the meeting ID in order to join\. For information about linking Alexa to online calendars, see [ Link Alexa to Your Calendar System](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/a4b/latest/ag/manage-calendaring.html)\.

When you use an Amazon Echo Show 8 device to join an Amazon Chime meeting, you don't need to sign into an Amazon Chime account on the device\. You join the meeting anonymously, and your name appears in the meeting roster as the name on the Amazon account that is linked to your device\. During the meeting, you can view the meeting roster and access controls for muting and unmuting and turning video on and off\. You can also see whether the meeting is being recorded and view screens that are shared with you\.
