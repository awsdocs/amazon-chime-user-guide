# Using Echo devices to join Amazon Chime meetings<a name="join-with-echo"></a>

You can use several Echo devices to join Amazon Chime meetings\. Some devices allow you to join video meetings, and other devices only allow you to join audio meetings\.

**Note**  
To schedule meetings, you must use one of the Amazon Chime clients\. For more information, see [Scheduling meetings using Amazon Chime](chime-schedule-meetings.md)\.

**System requirements for joining Amazon Chime meetings \(video and audio\)**  
To join Amazon Chime meetings from an Echo device with video and audio, you must have the following:
+ An Amazon Echo Show 8\.
+ Optionally, you can link Alexa to an online calendar using the Alexa app\. If you do, Alexa joins you to meetings automatically\. If you don't, at the time of the meeting you'll need to say the meeting ID in order to join\. For information about linking Alexa to online calendars, see [ Link Alexa for Business to Your Calendar System](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/a4b/latest/ag/manage-calendaring.html)\.

When you use an Amazon Echo Show 8 device to join an Amazon Chime meeting, you don't need to sign into an Amazon Chime account on the device\. You join the meeting anonymously, and your name appears in the meeting roster as the name on the Amazon account that is linked to your device\. During the meeting, you can view the meeting roster and access controls for muting and unmuting and turning video on and off\. You can also see whether the meeting is being recorded and view screens that are shared with you\.

**System requirements for joining Amazon Chime meetings \(audio only\)**  
You must have the following to join Amazon Chime meetings from an Echo device with audio only:
+ An Amazon Echo, Echo Dot, Echo Plus, Echo Spot, a 10\-inch Echo Show 2, or an Echo Auto\.
+ Your account set up for Alexa Communications\.
+ You must also have a linked calendar account\. Unlike video meetings, you must link Alexa to an online calendar for audio meetings\. For information about doing that, see [ Link Alexa for Business to Your Calendar System](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.aws.amazon.com/a4b/latest/ag/manage-calendaring.html)\.

**To join Amazon Chime meetings with Alexa**
+ Say the following as written: "Alexa, join my Amazon Chime meeting," or "Alexa, join my Chime meeting\."

If your calendar is linked with Alexa, you are prompted to confirm the meeting before you join it\.

For video meetings, if your calendar is not linked with Alexa, you are prompted for the meeting ID before you join the meeting\.
