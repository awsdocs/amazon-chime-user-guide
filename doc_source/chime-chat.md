# Chat with Users<a name="chime-chat"></a>

All meeting attendees who have the Amazon Chime app have access to chat\. Chat for a meeting is available after a meeting begins, and becomes unavailable when the meeting ends\.

All chat messages are public, meaning any message posted is visible to all meeting attendees\.

Messages can include both file attachments and emojis\.

To save all of the chat messages for a meeting, press Ctrl \+ A to copy the messages before the meeting ends\.
