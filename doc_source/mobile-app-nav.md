**The Navigation bar**  
Use the Navigation bar at the bottom of the Amazon Chime mobile app window to move around the app\.

You can join meetings, view your call history, send instant messages, and manage your chat rooms and contacts\.   
Choosing an item on the Navigation bar opens its corresponding *view*\. Each view contains *pages*\. For example, when you choose the **Calls** view, the **Call history** page appears\. The app displays the **Meetings** view by default\.  
On certain pages in the app, the Navigation bar won't be visible\. For example, the Navigation bar disappears when you message someone\. To see the Navigation bar, choose the Back button on your device\.

**The Answer control**  
When a meeting or person calls you on Amazon Chime, the **Answer** control appears\.

The control appears in any view within the app\. On iOS devices, the control can also appear on the lock screen\. To use the Answer control from the lock screen on iOS devices, see [Meeting and call settings](app-options.md#mobile-meetings-settings)

**Actions menus**  
You can take multiple actions on your contacts, messages, and chat rooms\. To see the actions you can take on a given item, tap the item to open its actions menu\. For example, a **Message from** action menu appears when you tap any chat message:

The commands on the menu vary depending on the item that you tap\. When you tap to open the **Message from** action menu, you can copy or quote a message, or cancel to close the menu\.

**Ellipsis menus**  
When you join a meeting, a vertical ellipsis icon appears in the upper\-right corner of the app window\. ![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/chime/latest/ug/images/mobile-kebab-menu.png)   
When you chat with someone or enter a chat room, a horizontal ellipsis icon appears in the upper\-right corner\. ![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/chime/latest/ug/images/mobile-horiz-ellipse.jpg)   
Choosing either type of ellipsis opens a menu of options for meetings and chats\. To learn more about these options, see [Additional meeting actions](mobile-mtg-options.md)\.
